GUTINDEX.01 is a plain text listing of eBooks posted to the Project
Gutenberg collection between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001
with eBook numbers starting at 2451.

It is _not_ a database, but it is useful for identifying eBooks so that
they can be downloaded by means other than directly from the website,
such as ftp or wget.

For a detailed explanation of Project Gutenberg files and filenaming
procedures, refer to the file GUTINDEX.ALL.
